# Specification Quality Checklist: Calendar Reliability

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec references specific code locations (file paths, function names) in the Context section only — this is intentional to document why previous fixes failed, not to prescribe implementation
- The "Context: Why Previous Fixes Failed" section is unique to this spec and essential because three prior attempts already addressed these issues at the prompt level
- SC-002 uses 90% threshold for recurring event detection because some edge cases (user explicitly asks for individual events) justify non-recurring creation
