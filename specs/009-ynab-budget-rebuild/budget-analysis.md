# YNAB Budget Analysis & Rebuild Plan

**Prepared for**: Jason & Erin's Family Meeting
**Date**: February 2026
**Data Source**: YNAB API — Dec 2025, Jan 2026, Feb 2026 actuals

---

## Executive Summary

Your YNAB budget was built in January 2025 during the Mint migration and hasn't been updated as your life has changed. The result: **goals that don't match reality**, categories that cause confusion, and $3,110 in uncategorized transactions this month alone. The budget *structure* is actually pretty good — it just needs a tune-up to reflect what you actually spend, not what you wished you spent a year ago.

The good news: your savings foundation is incredible ($150k emergency fund, all bills on autopilot). The fix is straightforward — update goals to match reality, consolidate confusing categories, and set up a system so the bot helps you maintain it going forward.

## Current State: By the Numbers

### Monthly Spending (excluding transfers & savings)

| Month | Total Spending | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Dec 2025 | $20,230 | Lower month (holiday spending in Gifts/Travel) |
| Jan 2026 | $32,160 | High — $11k maintenance spike, $1.8k house projects |
| Feb 2026 | $24,261 | On pace (24 days in) |
| **3-Month Average** | **$25,550/mo** | **$306,600 annualized** |

**Note on income**: Jason receives bonuses and stock compensation throughout the year in addition to base salary. The budget should account for this variable income — YNAB's approach is to budget only money you currently have, then assign bonus/stock income to priorities when it arrives (see Recommendation #8 below).

### Budget Structure

- **54 categories** across **17 groups** — on the high side, causing decision fatigue
- **$52,091 spent** vs **$32,219 budgeted** in Feb — budget doesn't reflect reality
- **$3,110 uncategorized** this month (mostly credit card transfers + a few real purchases)
- **30 savings goals** — many wildly disconnected from actual spending

## Problem #1: Goals That Don't Match Reality

This is the core issue. When goals are aspirational rather than realistic, you stop trusting the budget and start ignoring it. YNAB's philosophy is: **set goals based on what you actually spend, then gradually adjust.**

### Categories Where Goal Is Too Low (You Consistently Overspend)

| Category | Monthly Goal | 3-Mo Avg Spend | Gap | Reality-Based Goal |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Restaurants** | $400 | $1,206 | +$806 | $1,200 |
| **Groceries** | $1,600 | $2,354 | +$754 | $2,400 |
| **Subscriptions Used By All** | $150 | $927 | +$777 | $900 |
| **Other Healthcare** | $400 | $1,878 | +$1,478 | $1,900 |
| **Kids Activities** | $348 | $736 | +$388 | $750 |
| **Kids Toys/Games** | $100 | $462 | +$362 | $450 |
| **House Cleaning** | $420 | $512 | +$92 | $525 |
| **Chiro** | $160 | $533 | +$373 | $550 |
| **Dog food Chewy** | $100 | $136 | +$36 | $140 |
| **Once Upon a Child** | $100 | $187 | +$87 | $200 |
| **Maintenance** | $1,000 | $3,796 | +$2,796 | See note* |

*Maintenance is spiky — $186 in Dec, $11,068 in Jan, $133 in Feb. A $1,000/mo goal with a savings buffer for big repairs is the right approach — just needs a larger savings target ($5,000-$10,000 reserve).*

**Restaurant deep-dive**: 39 transactions in Feb, pattern is DoorDash on busy weeknights + coffee runs (Coffeebar, Starbucks, Walden's). The $400 goal was probably aspirational from when you set up YNAB. Realistic target: $1,000-$1,200 with a sub-strategy to reduce DoorDash by meal-prepping for busy nights.

### Categories Where Goal Is Too High (Overfunded)

| Category | Monthly Goal | 3-Mo Avg Spend | Excess/Mo |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Emergency Fund** | $80,000 | $0 (fully funded) | See savings section |
| **Buenos** | $980 | $0 | $980 — what is this? |
| **Haircuts** | $2,520 | $289 | $2,231 |
| **Dentist** | $200 | $72 | $128 |
| **Dog services** | $250 | $22 | $228 |
| **DMV registration** | $500 | $208 | $292 |
| **Erin Real Estate Expenses** | $4,000 | $237 | $3,763 |
| **Kids School** | $256 | $28 | $228 |
| **Kids Health** | $300 | $0 | $300 |
| **Home Insurance** | $1,999 | $9 | $1,990 (annual?) |
| **HOA** | $273 | $101 | $172 (quarterly?) |
| **Erin Subscriptions** | $50 | $17 | $33 |

**Note**: Some of these (Home Insurance, HOA, DMV) are likely annual/quarterly expenses with savings targets — the goal isn't "monthly spending" but "save this much so it's ready when due." That's fine, but the targets should reflect the actual annual cost divided by 12. Haircuts at $2,520/mo goal vs $289/mo actual suggests this might be an annual goal that got entered monthly.

### Categories With No Goal (Needs One)

| Category | 3-Mo Avg Spend | Suggested Goal |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Amazon** | $524 | $500 |
| **Erin Shopping** | $1,076 | $1,000 |
| **Jason Fun** | $1,112 | $1,000 |
| **Home Repairs** | $1,226 | $500 + reserve |
| **House Projects** | $770 | $500 + reserve |
| **Gifts** | $175 | $200 |
| **Erin Home Decor** | $294 | $300 |
| **Jason Shopping** | $108 | $150 |
| **Other Giving** | $85 | $100 |

## Problem #2: Category Confusion

### Uncategorized Transactions ($3,110 in Feb)

Breaking down what's actually in "Uncategorized":

| Transaction | Amount | What It Actually Is |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Tires.com | $2,539 | → Car Maintenance |
| Novaalab | $325 | → ? (skin care? research needed) |
| HOA payment | $234 | → HOA |
| Flamingo | $12 | → ? (restaurant? entertainment?) |
| Credit card transfers (6) | $29,795 total | → These are internal transfers, NOT spending |

**The credit card transfers are inflating your "uncategorized" problem.** YNAB should auto-match these as transfers between accounts. If they're showing as uncategorized, your credit card accounts may need to be set up as "linked" accounts in YNAB so transfers auto-reconcile.

### Categories That Should Be Merged or Removed

| Current | Recommendation | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Buenos ($980 goal, $0 spent) | Delete or merge into Restaurants | Appears unused — is this a sinking fund for a specific restaurant? |
| CVS ($32/mo avg) | Merge into "Pharmacy/Health" under Healthcare | Too small for its own category |
| Once Upon a Child ($187/mo) | Merge into "Kids Clothing" or "Kids Toys/Games" | Vendor-specific categories add confusion |
| Unclear Big Vendor Needs Category | Delete | This is a holding pen — force categorization |
| Unclear Venmo or Other Small Stuff | Delete | Same — review and categorize, then remove |
| Dog food Chewy + Dog services | Merge into single "Dog/Pet" | 2 categories for ~$158/mo total |

### Categories That Should Be Split

| Current | Recommendation | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Restaurants ($1,206/mo) | Split into "Dining Out" + "Coffee/Drinks" | Coffee is ~$200/mo and a different spending behavior than dinner out. Seeing it separately helps. |
| Car Gas / Car Wash | Keep as-is | Fine together |

### Trip Categories Proliferation

You have **6 separate trip categories**: SF Trip, San Diego Trip, Great Wolf Lodge, James Birthday, Erin Girls' Trip, Yearly Mexico Trip.

**YNAB best practice**: Create one **"Travel Fund"** sinking fund. When planning a specific trip, set the goal. Use memo tags on transactions to track per-trip spending. Once the trip is done, reset the goal for the next one. This keeps your category list clean and lets the fund grow between trips.

## Problem #3: Emergency Fund & Savings Strategy

### Current State
- Emergency Fund: **$149,997** funded against $80,000 goal (187%)
- Your target: **$200,000** (2 years of living expenses)

### Reality Check on the $200k Target

Your actual monthly spending averages **$25,550**. That means:

| Runway | Amount Needed |
|--------|--------------|
| 3 months (standard advice) | $76,650 |
| 6 months (conservative) | $153,300 |
| 1 year | $306,600 |
| 2 years | $613,200 |

**$200k would cover about 7.8 months** of your current spending — not 2 years. To get 2 years at current spending, you'd need ~$613k.

However, "2 years of living expenses" typically means **essential expenses only** — not restaurants, travel, shopping, etc. If we strip to essentials:

| Essential Category | Monthly |
|-------------------|---------|
| Mortgage | $2,185 |
| Utilities | $408 |
| Home Insurance | ~$167/mo (annual) |
| HOA | ~$91/mo (quarterly) |
| Groceries | $2,354 |
| Car Insurance | $233 |
| Car Gas | $228 |
| Healthcare (chiro + other) | $533 + ~$600 |
| Kids School/Activities | ~$764 |
| Dog | $158 |
| **Essential Total** | **~$7,721/mo** |

At $7,721/mo essential spending, 2 years = **$185,300**. So your **$200k target is actually well-calibrated** for 2 years of essential living expenses. You're at $150k now — $50k to go.

**Recommendation**: Update the Emergency Fund goal from $80,000 → **$200,000**. You're 75% there.

### Handling Bonuses & Stock Compensation

YNAB's approach to variable income:

1. **Don't budget money you don't have yet** — only assign dollars that are in your accounts today
2. **When a bonus/stock vesting hits**: Assign it to priorities in this order:
   - Top off any underfunded essential categories for the month
   - Fund the Emergency Fund gap ($50k remaining to hit $200k)
   - Fund upcoming known expenses (travel, car maintenance reserve, home repairs)
   - Fun money / discretionary
3. **Create a "Next Month's Buffer" category** — if you want to get ahead, fund next month's entire budget from this month's income. This is YNAB's "Rule 4: Age Your Money."

The bot can help with this: when a large deposit lands, Erin can say "I just got Jason's bonus, where should this go?" and the bot can check which categories are underfunded and suggest an allocation plan.

## Problem #4: Naming & Organization Issues

### Naming Inconsistencies
- "Dog services " (trailing space)
- "DMV registration " (trailing space)
- "Kids Toys/Games/etc." (inconsistent punctuation)
- "Erin Work Budget" group contains Jason's memoir business

### Proposed Group Reorganization

**Current: 17 groups, 54 categories**
**Proposed: 13 groups, ~42 categories**

| Group | Categories | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Fixed Bills** | Mortgage, Utilities, HOA, Home Insurance, Car Insurance | Non-negotiable monthly/periodic |
| **Home** | House Cleaning, Home Repairs, House Projects, Maintenance | All house spending |
| **Food** | Groceries, Dining Out, Coffee/Drinks | Split restaurants; remove Buenos |
| **Car** | Gas/Car Wash, DMV, Maintenance | Remove trailing spaces |
| **Healthcare** | Chiro, Dentist, Pharmacy, Other Healthcare | Merge CVS into Pharmacy |
| **Kids** | Activities, School, Clothing/Toys, Health | Merge Once Upon a Child + Toys |
| **Pet** | Dog (single category) | Merge food + services |
| **Subscriptions** | Family Shared, Amazon, Erin's, Jason's | Keep split — helps track |
| **Fun Money** | Jason Fun, Jason Shopping, Erin Shopping, Erin Home Decor | Consolidate personal spending |
| **Giving** | Church, Gifts, Other Giving | Fine as-is |
| **Work** | Erin Real Estate, Jason Memoir | Rename group to "Work/Business" |
| **Savings** | Emergency Fund ($200k goal), Travel Fund, Bonus Allocation | Consolidate 6 trip cats → 1 |
| **Credit Cards** | (auto-managed) | Fix transfer matching |

## Recommended Action Plan for Meeting

### Quick Wins (Do This Week)

1. **Categorize the 4 real uncategorized transactions** (Tires.com → Maintenance, HOA payment → HOA, research Novaalab and Flamingo)
2. **Fix credit card transfer matching** — those 6 transfer transactions shouldn't be uncategorized
3. **Update Emergency Fund goal** from $80,000 → $200,000
4. **Clean up trailing spaces** in category names (Dog services, DMV registration)

### Budget Rebuild (Family Meeting Project)

5. **Update all goals to reality-based targets** using the table above — start with the "Goal Too Low" categories since those cause the most monthly frustration
6. **Add goals to ungrouped categories** (Amazon, Erin Shopping, Jason Fun, etc.)
7. **Merge small/redundant categories** (Buenos, CVS, Once Upon a Child, Unclear categories)
8. **Consolidate trip categories** into single Travel Fund
9. **Split Restaurants** into Dining Out + Coffee/Drinks (optional but insightful)
10. **Set up bonus/stock allocation strategy** — create "Bonus Allocation" holding category

### Ongoing Maintenance (Bot-Assisted)

11. **Weekly budget check**: Bot already flags overspending in the daily briefing and meeting prep
12. **Bonus allocation**: When large deposits arrive, ask the bot where to assign the money
13. **Trip planning**: Ask the bot to set up a travel goal ("we're planning Disneyland in June, budget $3,000")
14. **Monthly review**: Bot can compare this month's spending to goals and flag categories drifting off target

## Discussion Points for Family Meeting

1. **Restaurant spending**: $1,200/mo avg is 3x the original $400 goal. Is this a number you want to actively reduce, or should the goal just reflect reality? The DoorDash pattern (9 orders in Feb, often on busy weeknights) suggests meal-prepping for those nights could save $300-400/mo without feeling restrictive.

2. **Emergency fund target**: Confirm $200k as the goal (covers 2 years essential expenses). You're at $150k — how aggressively to close the $50k gap? Should bonus/stock income prioritize this?

3. **Category simplification**: Are you comfortable merging the recommended categories? The goal is fewer categories = less decision fatigue = fewer things landing in "uncategorized."

4. **Buenos**: What is this? $980 goal with $0 spent for 3 months. Delete it?

5. **Haircuts goal**: $2,520/mo goal vs $289/mo actual spending. Is this an annual sinking fund entered wrong? Should be ~$300/mo if monthly.

6. **Should the bot help maintain this?** The bot can already move money between categories and update budgets. We could add a monthly "budget health check" that compares actual vs goals and suggests adjustments — keeping the budget alive instead of letting it go stale again.
